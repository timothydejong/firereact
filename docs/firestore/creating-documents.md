# Creating Documents

You can use one of the ways below to create documents in Firebase:

 - [`useAddDocument` hook](../hooks/useAddDocument.md) to add a document into a collection with a random-generated ID
 - [`useSetDocument` hook](../hooks/useSetDocument.md) to add a document by defining its path (thus, its ID)
