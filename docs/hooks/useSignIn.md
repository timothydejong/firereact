# `useSignIn` Hook

`useSignIn` hook is used to sign in a user. A very simple example would be:

```typescript
const { dispatch } = useSignIn(auth);
await dispatch({
  type: "classic",
  email,
  password,
});
```

!!! warning
`useSignIn` is lazy by default and will not do anything until you use `dispatch` function.

You can also get the state[^unauthorized] of sign-in process.

```typescript
const { state, dispatch } = useSignIn(auth);
await dispatch({
  type: "classic",
  email,
  password,
});
// `state` is "ready" | "loading" | "authenticated" | "awaiting"
```

!!! warning
`useSignIn` automatically listens to authentication state and will be `"authenticated"` if the user is authenticated. In `"authenticated"` state, `dispatch` will simply do nothing even if it is invoked.

`dispatch` function will return an instance of [`UserCredential` | `undefined`][UserCredentialDocRef].

```typescript
const { state, dispatch } = useSignIn(auth);
const credential = await dispatch({
  type: "classic",
  email,
  password,
});
// do something with `credential`
```

## Input Parameters

Input parameters for `useSignIn` hook is as follows:

| Name   | Type                               | Description                                      | Required | Default Value |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| `auth` | [`firebase/auth/Auth`][AuthRefDoc] | Reference to the Firebase Auth service instance. | ✅       | -             |

## Return Type

`useSignIn` hook returns an object with properties as below:

| Name       | Type                                      | Description                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `state`    | `"ready"                                  | "loading"                            | "authenticated"`[^unauthorized] | The state of sign-up process. |
| `dispatch` | [`UseSignInDispatcher`](#sign-in-methods) | A callback to start sign-up process. |

## Sign In Methods

There are many sign-in methods available. The available ones are:

| Method             | `type`      | `provider`                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Email and password | `classic`   | ❌                                                   |
| Email link         | `link`      | ❌                                                   |
| Google             | `google`    | [`GoogleAuthProvider`][GoogleAuthProviderRefDoc]     |
| Facebook           | `facebook`  | [`FacebookAuthProvider`][FacebookAuthProviderRefDoc] |
| Apple              | `apple`     | [`OAuthProvider`][OAuthProviderRefDoc]               |
| Microsoft          | `microsoft` | [`OAuthProvider`][OAuthProviderRefDoc]               |
| Yahoo              | `yahoo`     | [`OAuthProvider`][OAuthProviderRefDoc]               |
| Twitter            | `twitter`   | [`TwitterAuthProvider`][TwitterAuthProviderRefDoc]   |
| Github             | `github`    | [`GithubAuthProvider`][GithubAuthProviderRefDoc]     |

`dispatch` function will require an object as parameter. This object will always have property of `type: string`. `type` will correspond to what kind of method you will prefer while signing in a visitor.

### Classic (Email and Password) Sign In Method

If `type` is `"classic"` (email-password authentication), it's pretty simple:

```typescript
const credential = await dispatch({
  type: "classic",
  email,
  password,
});
```

If no verification email was sent and the user is not verified, your `credential!.user.emailVerified` will return `false`. After you sign in, you can use [`useSendEmailVerification`](useSendEmailVerification.md) hook to send an email verification to the user.

### Email Link Sign In Method

If `type` is `"link"`, the example would be:

```typescript
await dispatch({
  type: "link",
  email,
  actionCodeSettings,
});
```

You will need `actionCodeSettings`. You can see [this section in Firebase Auth documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/email-link-auth#send_an_authentication_link_to_the_users_email_address) to see it.

`"link"` is **the only type that will return `undefined` credential** as the user has to click the link in the email to get authenticated. Also, it is **the only method to change the state to `"awaiting"`**.

### Other Methods

If `type` is something else, you need to provide an implementation of `AuthProvider`. An example for Google sign-in looks as such:

```typescript
const { state, dispatch } = useSignIn(auth);
const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
await dispatch({
  type: "google",
  provider,
});
// state is "loading" until user successfully signs in, then "authenticated"
```

!!! warning
You might need to take extra steps to use 3rd-party authentication systems, e.g. for Apple, you need to comply with their anonymized data requirements. Although authentication via Google is mostly okay and require less hassle (as Firebase is a product of Google), you might want to check individual documents of each 3rd-party provider [here][AuthWebDocs]. Choose the provider of your choice from the left menu.

[^unauthorized]: You can consider `"authenticated"` state as logically _unauthorized_. Your website visitors are not authorized to sign in again if they are already authenticated (signed-in).
