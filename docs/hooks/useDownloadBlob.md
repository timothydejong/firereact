# `useDownloadBlob` Hook

`useDownloadBlob` hook is used to directly download a file as bytes from Firebase Storage. Instead of [`useDownloadLink` hook](./useDownloadLink.md), this hook might be useful to process a file byte by byte instead of directly downloading to the user's machine.

A very simple example would be:

```typescript
const reference = ref(storage, "path/to/remote/file.png");
const { dispatch } = useDownloadBlob(reference);
const blob = await dispatch(file);
```

!!! warning
    `useDownloadBlob` is lazy by default and will not do anything until you use `dispatch` function.

You can get the state of the progress with this example.

```typescript
const { state } = useDownloadBlob(reference);
const blob = await dispatch();
// `state` is "ready" | "loading" | "done"
```

`dispatch` method will return an instance of [`Blob`][BlobDoc], but additionally, you can also listen to [`Blob`][BlobDoc] from `useDownloadBlob` hook as well:

```typescript
const { blob } = useDownloadBlob(reference);
// blob updates and rerenders when the state is `"done"`
// until then, it is `undefined`
await dispatch();
```

## Input Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Required | Default Value |

## Return Type

`useDownloadBlob` hook returns an object with properties as below:

| Name | Type | Description |

| `state` | `"ready" | "loading" | "done"` | The state of the process. |
| `dispatch` | `(maxDownloadSizeBytes? number) => Promise<string>` | A callback to start the process and return the link. You can also define how many bytes to download at most. |
