# `useDeleteFile` Hook

`useDeleteFile` hook is used to delete a file from Firebase Storage. A very simple example would be:

```typescript
const reference = ref(storage, "path/to/remote/file.png");
const { dispatch } = useDeleteFile(reference);
await dispatch();
```

!!! warning
    `useDeleteFile` is lazy by default and will not do anything until you use `dispatch` function.

You can also listen to the state:

```typescript
const { state } = useDeleteFile(reference);
await dispatch();
// `state` is "ready" | "loading" | "done"
```
