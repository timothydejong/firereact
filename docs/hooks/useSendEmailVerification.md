# `useSendEmailVerification` hook

`useSendEmailVerification` hook is used to send email verification to a user. A very simple example would be:

```typescript
const { dispatch } = useSendEmailVerification(auth);
await dispatch();
```

!!! warning
`useSendEmailVerification` is lazy by default and will not do anything until you use `dispatch` function.

You can also get the state of the process.

```typescript
const { state, dispatch } = useSendEmailVerification(auth);
await dispatch();
// `state` is "ready" | "loading" | "done" | "anonymous"
```

!!! warning
`useSendEmailVerification` automatically listens to authentication state and will be `"anonymous"` if the user has not signed in. In `"anonymous"` state (or any state other than `"ready"` to be exact), `dispatch` will simply do nothing even if it is invoked.
